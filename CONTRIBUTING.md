## Coding style
We use JavaScript Standard Style. [You can review the rules here.](https://standardjs.com/rules.html#javascript-standard-style)
When you do a pull request, stickler-ci checks the code if it's compliant.

[Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used for the user interface, it's preferable to run [bootlint](https://github.com/twbs/bootlint#in-the-browser) to check for errors.
