## Coding style
For javascript:
- camelCase variables
- spaces around operators
- 4 spaces for indentation
- end statements with a semicolon (`;`)
- ECMAScript 5

The user interface is made in Bootstrap 3. It's preferable that you run a Bootstrap linter such as the [bookmarklet of bootlint](https://github.com/twbs/bootlint#in-the-browser) to remove common errors.
